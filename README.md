# KFritz

KFritz is a KDE Plasma Plasmoid that connects to your AVM Fritz!Box and displays real-time incoming call notifications. It shows the caller name and number, maintains a history of recent calls, and integrates with the KDE notification system for alerts.

Designed for modern Plasma 6 environments, KFritz supports:
- Real-time call monitoring via the FritzBox CallMonitor (port 1012)
- Caller name resolution from the FritzBox phonebook via TR-064
- Recent call history with timestamps
- Compact and full Plasma representations
- KDE notifications using KNotification
